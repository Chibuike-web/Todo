# Fullstack Todo Applications ✅

A collection of fullstack Todo applications built to explore and master CRUD operations across modern frontend and backend technologies. These apps are powered by **PostgreSQL** for fast and efficient local database operations, with two implementations:

- **Todo-Express** – Using Express.js + React
- **Todo-Next** – Using Next.js for a unified fullstack experience

---

## 🗂️ Projects Overview

### 📁 `Todo-Express`

- Fullstack architecture using:
  - **React (Vite)** for the frontend
  - **Express.js** for the backend
  - **PostgreSQL** for the database
  - **Zustand** for client-side state management
- RESTful API structure for task CRUD operations

### 📁 `Todo-Next`

- Fullstack in one unified Next.js application:
  - **Next.js App Router**
  - Built-in API routes for server logic
  - **PostgreSQL** for persistent storage
  - **Zustand** for frontend state
- Server/client integration within one codebase

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React** – Frontend UI
- **Next.js** – Fullstack framework (Todo-Next)
- **Express.js** – Backend server (Todo-Express)
- **Vite** – Fast React dev server (Todo-Express)
- **PostgreSQL** – High-performance relational database
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first responsive design
- **Zustand** – Global state management
- **Node.js** – Server runtime environment

## 🧠 Learning Focus

- Building **CRUD** operations end-to-end
- Managing relational data with **PostgreSQL**
- Structuring scalable APIs (REST & API Routes)
- Creating reusable UI and state logic
- Preparing for third-party integrations (e.g. Google APIs)

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

- 📅 **Google Calendar Sync** – Create and manage events from tasks
- ⏰ Notifications, reminders, and optional real-time features

## 💡 Goal

To develop and refine fullstack engineering skills through practical application. These projects serve as a foundation for mastering frontend/backend integration, authentication, and data-driven interfaces — while setting the stage for more advanced SaaS-like features.
